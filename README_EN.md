openYuanrong is a serverless distributed compute engine that unifies diverse workloads, from AI and big data to microservices, on a single, streamlined architecture. It provides multi-language function interfaces that simplify the development of complex distributed applications to feel just like writing a local program. Powered by dynamic scheduling and efficient data sharing, openYuanrong ensures high-performance execution and maximum cluster resource utilization.

## Overview

</div>

openYuanrong supports modular, on-demand usage of a multi-language function runtime, function system, and data system.

- **Multi-language Function Runtime**: Build powerful, distributed applications in Python, Java, and C++ as easily as you would write a program for a single machine.
- **Function System**: Maximize cluster resource utilization with dynamic scheduling, which seamlessly scales and migrates function instances across nodes.
- **Data System**: Accelerate data transfer between function instances using a multi-level distributed caching system that supports both object and stream semantics.

In openYuanrong, the function is a core abstraction that extends the serverless model. It behaves like a process in a single-machine OS, representing a running instance of a distributed application while offering native support for cross-function invocation.

openYuanrong consists of three code repositories:

- yuanrong: The multi-language function runtime (current repository).
- [yuanrong-functionsystem](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong-functionsystem): Refers to the function system repository.
- [yuanrong-datasystem](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong-datasystem): Refers to the data system repository.
