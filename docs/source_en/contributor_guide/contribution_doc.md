# Contribution Documentation

Documentation issues you discover can be reported to us by raising issues, and we also welcome your direct contributions: fixing errors (even punctuation marks), providing clearer explanations, supplementing section content, or creating new documentation.

This section will guide you through the preparation work before getting started.

## Which Documents Can You Contribute To

openYuanrong documentation mainly includes the following categories:

- [Getting Started](../getting_started.md)
- [Installation and Deployment](../deploy/installation.md)
- [Key Concepts](../multi_language_function_programming_interface/key_concept.md)
- [Development Guide](../multi_language_function_programming_interface/development_guide/index.md)

- [FAQ](../FAQ/multi_language_functional_programming.md)
- [API Reference](../multi_language_function_programming_interface/api/distributed_programming/Python/index.rst)

The openYuanrong documentation source code is stored in the `docs` directory of the [yuanrong](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/tree/master){target="_blank"} repository. You can refer to existing documentation content to supplement chapters in the corresponding documentation directories. The correspondence between first-level directories and code paths is as follows:

- Overview: overview.md
- Getting Started: getting_started.md
- Installation and Deployment: deploy
- Use Cases: use_cases
- Multi-language Function Programming Interface: multi_language_function_programming_interface
- More Usage: more_usage
- Observability: observability
- FAQ: FAQ
- Contributor Guide: contributor_guide
- Reference: reference
- Security: security.md

## Documentation Syntax and Build Tools

openYuanrong documentation is generated based on the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/){target="_blank"} build system. You can use Sphinx's native [reStructuredText (rST) syntax](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html){target="_blank"}, or use [Markdown syntax](https://markdown.com.cn/basic-syntax/){target="_blank"} (with [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){target="_blank"} extension) to write documentation.

Documentation content is mainly divided into two types:

- Getting Started, Tutorials, Cases: These documents are written using [basic markdown syntax](https://markdown.com.cn/basic-syntax/){target="_blank"} (referred to as `.md` below).

- API:

   - **English documentation** for Python API and C++ API uses [Sphinx's autodoc extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html){target="_blank"} to automatically generate API documentation from source code. Note that Python English API is written in [Google style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html){target="_blank"}, using sphinx and sphinx.autodoc to complete content construction and documentation embedding, no need to write additional documentation. C++ English API is written in [Doxygen style](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html){target="_blank"}, using doxygen and [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html){target="_blank"} to complete content construction and documentation embedding, requiring additional `.md` documentation.
   - **Chinese documentation** for Python API and C++ API is written using [reStructuredText (rST) syntax](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html){target="_blank"}, with English automatically generated completely.
   - For the sake of API documentation consistency, currently Java API **both Chinese and English documentation** are written using `.md` documents.

## How to Write Documentation

### Writing API Documentation

- Modify Python API documentation:

   - If you want to modify a Python API English document, you can click the blue `[source]` button in the upper right corner of the Python API English page to jump to its location in the code repository, and find the corresponding `.py` file in the English document storage path [python English repo-1](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/tree/master/api/python){target="_blank"} or [python English repo-2](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/tree/master/api/python/yr){target="_blank"} to modify the corresponding location. Following the basic principle of consistency between Chinese and English, when you modify the Python API English, please go to the corresponding Chinese document storage path to modify the API's Chinese document.
   - If you want to modify a Python API Chinese document, you can find the `.rst` document with the same name as the API in the Chinese document storage path [python Chinese repo](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/tree/master/docs/multi_language_function_programming_interface/api/distributed_programming/zh_cn/Python){target="_blank"} to modify. Similarly, following the basic principle of consistency between Chinese and English, please synchronously modify the API's English document.
   - If you want to add a new Python API, for English documentation, please find the corresponding `.py` file in the English document storage path mentioned above and write the **source code** and English documentation conforming to [Google style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html){target="_blank"} at the appropriate position; for Chinese documentation, create a `.rst` document with the same name as the API in the Chinese document storage path mentioned above for writing. **Finally**, please find the API type to which your interface belongs in the `index.rst` files: [English index](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/tree/master/docs/multi_language_function_programming_interface/api/distributed_programming/Python){target="_blank"}, [Chinese index](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/tree/master/docs/multi_language_function_programming_interface/api/distributed_programming/zh_cn/Python){target="_blank"}, and add your interface there. Refer to the following for adding method (taking Chinese `index.rst` as an example, two places need to be added):

   ```text
      .. toctree::
         :glob:
         :hidden:
         :maxdepth: 1

         yr.origin_API
         yr.new_API

      Certain Type API
      ---------

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 0
         :widths: 30 70

         * - :doc:`yr.origin_API`
           - Original API first sentence description.
         * - :doc:`yr.is_initialized`
           - New API first sentence description.
   ```

Refer to the Python API addition method shown above for adding method.

### Writing Other Documentation

Except for API, other documentation (getting started, tutorials, case documentation) is written by modifying or adding `.md` files. `.md` files are divided into two types by function: directory and content, with directory files uniformly using the filename `index.md`. Generally, directory files need to provide an "introduction" description of the directory content, you can refer to [file directory index.md](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/blob/master/docs/deploy/index.md){target="_blank"}. Newly added `.md` files will only take effect after adding the filename to the `index.md` file, for example: the [Installation Guide](https://atomgit.com/openeuler/yuanrong/blob/master/docs/deploy/installation.md){target="_blank"} under the openYuanrong documentation "Installation and Deployment" directory, its filename is within the above file directory.

```text
......
.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:

   installation
......
```

In addition to basic markdown syntax, common extended syntax can refer to examples in [Admonitions](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/admonitions.html){target="_blank"}, [Source code and APIs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/code_and_apis.html){target="_blank"}, and [Cross-references](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/cross-referencing.html){target="_blank"}.

## Development Tools

It is recommended to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"} tool, search and install the following two plugins in the Extensions bar:

- Markdown All in one: Can preview in real time. After installation, press Ctrl + Shift + P to call the main command box, select Markdown: Open Preview to the Side to open the preview effect
- markdownlint: Can check and help fix some syntax issues. Refer to [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/main/docs/RULES.md){target="_blank"} for complete check rules.

## Documentation Build and Testing

### Install Dependencies

- Refer to [Compile openYuanrong from Source Code](source_code_build.md) to install tools needed for compiling runtime.
- Download and install [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen){target="_blank"} (version 1.12.0 or above).
- Execute the following command in the code `docs` directory:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
   ```

### Build API

You need to compile runtime before API-related documentation can be generated. Execute the following command in the code `yuanrong` repository:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

### Build Documentation

Execute the following command in the code `yuanrong/docs` directory:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The generated files are in the `yuanrong/output/docs` directory. To rebuild, please delete the `yuanrong/docs/_build` directory first to avoid the impact of historical build files.

### Local Testing

In the build result `output` directory, execute the following command:

```bash
# Replace <port> with an available external port on the documentation build machine
python3 -m http.server <port> -d docs
```

Access in the browser: `http://<Your Documentation Build Host IP>:<port>/index.html`
